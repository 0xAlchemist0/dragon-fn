/* #1E1F24 (Base Background)

Used as the main backdrop for the site.

Feels dark but not oppressive — sets the tone without killing contrast.

#2A2B30 (Surface)

Applied to cards, modals, navbars, and UI containers.

Provides a subtle lift against the background for depth and separation.

#FF6B00 (Primary Accent)

Key branding color: buttons, call-to-action (CTA), highlights, hover states.

Matches your logo and creates strong focal points.

#FFC857 (Highlight/Secondary)

Used sparingly: hover effects, tags, highlights, icons.

Adds warmth and brightness without overwhelming.

#4C5C68 (Cool Contrast)

Optional for text links, borders, or background gradients.

Adds contrast and coolness to balance the warmth of the oranges.

#F4F4F5 (Primary Text)

Main text color for headers, body, and anything important.

Clean and high contrast for readability on dark surfaces.

#B0B3BA (Secondary Text)

For subtitles, descriptions, placeholders, metadata.

Softer, doesn’t compete with the main content.
