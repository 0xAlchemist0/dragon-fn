/* üêâ How Voting Works in Sonic Red Dragon (ve69LP system)
You lock LP tokens (liquidity provider tokens) into a ve69LP contract.

When you lock, you get voting power based on how much you lock and how long you lock it.

Your voting power lets you vote on pools (liquidity pools) to control where rewards and incentives get sent.

The longer you lock your LP tokens, the more voting weight you get (boosting your influence).

Fee distributions, boosts, and jackpots are often redirected to the pools with the most votes.

ve69LP.sol, ve69LPBoost.sol, ve69LPPoolVoting.sol, etc. handle all the locking, boosting, voting, and distribution logic. */
